to secure his family s finances  as his shady business progresses  walter gains a notorious reputation under the alias of  heisenberg   cranston stated that  though he enjoyed doing comedy  he decided he     should really focus on doing something else  but i think any good drama worth its weight always has a sprinkling of comedy in it  because you can ease the tension to an audience when it s

power and he knows he can take someone s life  he s just confident  15   bob odenkirk as saul goodman  recurring season 2  main cast season 3â€“5  â€“ a crooked strip mall lawyer who represents walt and jesse  odenkirk drew inspiration for goodman from film producer robert evans  i thought about robert evans because i ve listened to the kid stays in the picture on cd  he s constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery  he emphasizes interesting words  he has loads of attitude in almost every line that he says  so when i rehearse the scenes alone i do my impersonation of robert evans to find those moments and turns  then i go out and i do saul  16   jonathan banks as mike ehrmantraut  guest star season 2  main cast season 3â€“5a  â€“ works for gus as an all-purpose cleaner and hitman  and also works for saul as a private investigator  the character of mike has been compared to harvey keitel s winston wolf character in pulp fiction  which banks says he is not trying to emulate   i

production conception breaking bad was created by vince gilligan  who spent several years writing the fox series the x-files  gilligan wanted to create a series in which the protagonist became the antagonist   television is historically good at keeping its characters in a self-imposed stasis so that shows can go on for years or even decades   he said   when i realized this  the logical next step was to think  how can i do a show in which the fundamental drive is toward change   18  he added that his goal with walter white was to turn him from mr  chips into scarface  19  20  21  gilligan believed the concept of showing the full drastic transformation of a character across the run of a television show was a risky concept and would be difficult to pitch without other powerful factors to support it  such as strong cinematography and acting  22   the show s title is a southern colloquialism meaning  among other things   raising hell   and was chosen by gilligan to describe walter s transformation  23  according to time entertainment editor lily rothman  the term has a broader meaning and is an old phrase which  connotes more violence than  raising hell  does      t he words possess a wide variety of nuances  to  break bad  can mean to  go wild   to  defy authority   and break the law  to be verbally  combative  belligerent  or threatening  or  followed by the preposition  on    to dominate or humiliate    24   the concept emerged as gilligan talked with his fellow x-files writer thomas schnauz regarding their current unemployment and joked that the solution was for them to put a  meth lab in the back of an rv and  drive  around the country cooking meth and making money   25   after writing the concept for the show and pilot  gilligan pitched it to sony pictures television  who became very interested in supporting it  sony arranged for meetings with the various cable networks  showtime passed on this  as they had already started broadcasting weeds  a show with similarities to the premise of breaking bad  26  while his producers convinced him that the show was different enough to still be successful  gilligan later stated that he would not have gone forward with the idea had he known about weeds earlier  27  other networks like hbo and tnt also passed on the idea  but eventually fx took interest and began initial discussions on producing the pilot  26  at the same time  fx had also started development of dirt  a female-centric crime-based drama series  and with three existing male-centric shows already on the network  fx passed up breaking bad for dirt  26   one of gilligan s agents spoke to jeremy elice  the director of original programming for amc who was looking for more original shows to add alongside their upcoming mad men  elice was intrigued  and soon a meeting was set up between gilligan  elice  and two programming executives  gilligan was not optimistic about this meeting  fearing they would just put him off  but instead all three showed great interest  and the meeting ended up establishing how amc would acquire the rights from fx and set the pilot into production  it took about a year following this meeting before sony had set up the rights with amc and production could start  26   development history       breaking bad was filmed at various locations across albuquerque  clockwise from top left  the house used for the whites  home  the fast food restaurant that was used for los pollos hermanos  the crossroads motels used in-show for various drug deals  a rental home used for jane s and jesse s apartment  the car wash where walter works part-time  and the doghouse  a functioning drive-in restaurant  the network ordered nine episodes for the first season  including the pilot   but the 2007â€“08 writers guild of america strike limited the production to seven episodes  as well as delaying the start of production for the second season  28  within the original nine-episode arc  gilligan had planned to kill off jesse or hank  as a  ballsy  moment to end the season on  22  this death was eliminated with the limited episode count  which gilligan found to be a net positive given the strength of acting that both paul and norris brought to these roles through the seasons  22  the strike also helped to slow down production long enough for gilligan and his writing team to readjust the pacing of the show  which in the original arc had been moving too quickly  22  gould stated that the writer s strike  saved the show   as if they had produced the two additional episodes in the first season  they would have gone down a different creative path that he believes would have led to the show s cancellation by its third season  29   the initial versions of the script were set in riverside  california  but at the suggestion of sony  albuquerque was chosen for the production s location due to the favorable financial conditions offered by the state of new mexico  once gilligan recognized that this would mean  we d always have to be avoiding the sandia mountains  in shots directed toward the east  the story setting was changed to the actual production location  30  31  it was shot primarily on 35 mm film  32  with digital cameras employed as needed for additional angles  point of view shots and time-lapse photography  33  breaking bad cost  3 million per episode to produce  higher than the average cost for a basic cable program  34   around 2010  amc had expressed to sony pictures television and gilligan that they felt that the third season would be the last for breaking bad  sony started to shop the show around  having gained quick interest from the fx network for two more seasons  upon which amc changed its mind and allowed the show to continue  35  at the same time  netflix was starting to aggressively shop for content to add to its service and arranged a deal with sony for breaking bad to be available after the airing of the fourth season  knowing that amc had placed breaking bad on a potential cancellation route  sony pushed to have the show added to the service in time for the fourth season  breaking bad s viewership grew greatly as viewers binged the series on netflix  helping to assure that a fifth season could be made  the fifth-season premiere had more than double the viewership compared to the fourth season premiere  attributed to the netflix availability  35  gilligan thanked netflix at the emmy awards in september 2013 after the series  conclusion for the popularity of the series  saying that netflix  kept us on the air   36   as the series progressed  gilligan and the writing staff of breaking bad made walter increasingly unsympathetic  19  gilligan said during the run of the series   he s going from being a protagonist to an antagonist  we want to make people question who they re pulling for  and why   20  cranston said by the fourth season   i think walt s figured out it s better to be a pursuer than the pursued  he s well on his way to badass   21   in july 2011  vince gilligan indicated that he intended to conclude breaking bad at the end of its fifth season  37  in early august 2011  negotiations began over a deal regarding the fifth and possible final season between the network amc and sony pictures television  the production company of the series  amc proposed a shortened fifth season  six to eight episodes  instead of 13  to cut costs  but the producers declined  sony then approached other cable networks about possibly picking up the show if a deal could not be made  38  on august 14  2011  amc renewed the series for a fifth and final season consisting of 16 episodes  39  in april 2012  bryan cranston revealed that the fifth season would be split into two halves  with the first eight episodes airing in 2012  and the final eight in 2013  40   before the series finale  gilligan said that it was difficult to write for walter white because the character was so dark and morally questionable   i m going to miss the show when it s over  but on some level  it ll be a relief to not have walt in my head anymore   41  gilligan later said the idea for walter s character intrigued him so much that he  didn t really give much thought on how well it would sell   stating that he would have given up on the premise since it was  such an odd  dark story  that could have difficulties being pitched to studios  25  ultimately  gilligan chose to end breaking bad with walter s death  occurring in-story two years after he had first been diagnosed with cancer and given two years to live  gilligan said by the end of the series   it feels as if we should adhere to our promise that we explicitly made to our audience  from the first episode  42   casting  you re going to see that underlying humanity  even when he s making the most devious  terrible decisions  and you need someone who has that humanity â€“ deep down  bedrock humanity â€“ so you say  watching this show   all right  i ll go for this ride  i don t like what he s doing  but i understand  and i ll go with it for as far as it goes   if you don t have a guy who gives you that  despite the greatest acting chops in the world  the show is not going to succeed    â€”vince gilligan  about bryan cranston 43  breaking bad creator vince gilligan cast bryan cranston for the role of walter white based on having worked with him in the  drive  episode of the science fiction television series the x-files  on which gilligan worked as a writer  cranston played an anti-semite with a terminal illness who took series co-protagonist fox mulder  david duchovny  hostage  gilligan said the character had to be simultaneously loathsome and sympathetic  and that  bryan alone was the only actor who could do that  who could pull off that trick  and it is a trick  i have no idea how he does it   41  43  amc officials  who were initially reluctant with the casting choice  having known cranston only as the over-the-top character hal on the comedy series malcolm in the middle  approached actors john cusack and matthew broderick about the role  44  when both actors declined  the executives were persuaded to cast cranston after seeing his x-files episode  45   cranston contributed significantly to the formation and development of the walter white persona  when gilligan left much of walter s past unexplained during the development of the series  the actor wrote his own backstory for the character  41  at the start of the show  cranston gained 10 pounds to reflect the character s personal decline  and had the natural red highlights of his hair dyed brown  he collaborated with costume designer kathleen detoro on a wardrobe of mostly neutral green and brown colors to make the character bland and unremarkable  and worked with makeup artist frieda valenzuela to create a mustache he described as  impotent  and like a  dead caterpillar   46  cranston repeatedly identified elements in certain scripts where he disagreed with how the character was handled  47  and went so far as to call gilligan directly when he could not work out disagreements with the episode s screenwriters  cranston has said he was inspired partially by his elderly father for how walter carries himself physically  which he described as  a little hunched over  never erect   as if  the weight of the world is on this man s shoulders   in contrast to his character  cranston has been described as extremely playful on set  with aaron paul describing him as  a kid trapped in a man s body   41   aaron paul s casting was also initially questioned by production  as paul looked too old and too much like a  pretty boy  to be associated with meth cooking  gilligan reconsidered paul s skills after seeing his audition and recalling he had also had guest starred on the x-files episode  lord of the flies   26  gilligan originally intended for pinkman to be killed at the end of breaking bad s first season in a botched drug deal as a plot device to plague walter white with guilt  however  gilligan said by the second episode of the season  he was so impressed with paul s performance that  it became pretty clear early on that that would be a huge  colossal mistake  to kill off jesse   48  similarly  dean norris had shown his ability to be a law enforcement official in the x-files episode  f  emasculata   and was brought on to be hank schrader  walter s brother-in-law and dea agent  49   scientific accuracy donna nelson  a professor of organic chemistry at the university of oklahoma  checked scripts and provided dialogue  she also drew chemical structures and wrote chemical equations which were used as props  according to creator vince gilligan   dr  donna nelson from the university of oklahoma approached us several seasons back and said   i really like this show  and if you ever need help with the chemistry  i d love to lend a hand   she s been a wonderful advisor  we get help wherever we need it  whether it s chemistry  electrical engineering  or physics  we try to get everything correct  there s no full-time  advisor  on set  but we run certain scenes by these experts first  50    because walter white was talking to his students  i was able to dumb down certain moments of description and dialogue in the early episodes which held me until we had some help from some honest-to-god chemists   says gilligan  according to gilligan  nelson  vets our scripts to make sure our chemistry dialogue is accurate and up to date  we also have a chemist with the drug enforcement administration based out of dallas who has just been hugely helpful to us   51  nelson spoke of gilligan s interest in having the science right  saying that gilligan  said it made a difference to him   52    the gas mask worn when characters would cook meth in breaking bad is on display at the mob museum in las vegas  several episodes of mythbusters featured attempts to validate or disprove scenes from breaking bad  often with gilligan guest-starring in the episode to participate  in 2013  two scenes from the first season of breaking bad were put under scrutiny in a mythbusters breaking bad special  despite several modifications to what was seen in the show  both the scenes depicted in the show were shown to be physically impossible  53  it was shown impossible to use hydrofluoric acid to fully dissolve metal  flesh  or ceramic as shown in the episode  cat s in the bag      and that while it was possible to throw fulminated mercury against the floor to cause an explosion  as in the episode  crazy handful of nothin    walter would have needed a much larger quantity of the compound and thrown at a much faster speed  and likely would have killed all in the room  54  55  a later mythbusters episode   blow it out of the water   tested the possibility of mounting an automated machine gun in a car as in the series finale  felina   and found it plausible  56  an episode of mythbusters jr  proved that it was impossible for an electromagnet to draw metallic objects from across a room as in the episode  live free or die   57   jason wallach of vice magazine commended the accuracy of the cooking methods presented in the series  in early episodes  a once-common clandestine method  the nagai red phosphorus/iodine method  is depicted  which uses pseudoephedrine as a precursor to d- + -methamphetamine  58  by the season 1 finale  walt chooses to use a different synthetic route based on the difficulty of acquiring enough pseudoephedrine to produce on the larger scale required  the new method walt chooses is a reductive amination reaction  relying on phenyl-2-propanone and methylamine  on the show  the phenyl-2-propanone  otherwise known as phenylacetone or p2p  is produced from phenylacetic acid and acetic acid using a tube furnace and thorium dioxide  tho2  as a catalyst  as mentioned in episodes  a no rough-stuff-type deal  and  mã¡s   p2p and methylamine form an imine intermediate; reduction of this p2p-methylamine imine intermediate is performed using mercury aluminum amalgam  as shown in several episodes  including  hazard pay   59    the meth in each episode was blue candy created by the employees at  the candy lady   one of the important plot points in the series is that the crystal meth walter  cooks  has very long crystals  is very pure  and  despite its purity  has a strong cyan blue color  pure crystal meth would be clear or white  60   in their article  die chemie bei breaking bad  on chemie in unserer zeit  translated into english on chemistryviews as  the chemistry of breaking bad    tunga salthammer and falk harnish discuss the plausibility of the chemistry portrayed in certain scenes  according to the two  chemistry is clearly depicted as a manufacturing science without much explanation of analytical methods being provided  they also note  serious scientific subjects are mixed into the dialogue in order to show a world where chemistry plays a key role  60   technical aspects michael slovis was the cinematographer of breaking bad  beginning with the second season  and he received critical acclaim for his work throughout the series  critics appreciated the bold visual style adopted by the tv series  although series creator vince gilligan and slovis wanted to shoot breaking bad in cinemascope  sony and amc did not grant them permission  gilligan cited sergio leone s westerns as a reference for how he wanted the series to look  61  slovis received four primetime emmy award nominations for outstanding cinematography for a one hour series and outstanding cinematography for a single-camera series  62   breaking bad was shot on 35 mm movie film because of the robustness of the equipment and to keep a focus on shooting scenes economically  it also allowed for a later digital transfer to 4k ultra hd resolution  63  by the end of the fifth season  episodes had cost upwards of us 6 million to produce  35   kelley dixon was one of the few editors of breaking bad and edited many of the series   meth montages   for the montages  she would use techniques such as jump cuts and alternating the speed of the film  either faster or slower  64  for her work  she received six primetime emmy award nominations for outstanding single-camera picture editing for a drama series and won

interview with the new york times  creator vince gilligan said the larger lesson of the series is that  actions have consequences   41  he elaborated on the show s philosophy   if religion is a reaction of man  and nothing more  it seems to me that it represents a human desire for wrongdoers to be punished  i hate the idea of idi amin living in saudi arabia for the last 25 years of his life  that galls me to no end  i feel some sort of need for biblical atonement  or justice  or something  i like to believe there is some comeuppance  that karma kicks in at some point  even if it takes years or decades to happen  my girlfriend says this great thing that s become my philosophy as well   i want to believe there s a heaven  but i can t not believe there s a hell    in a piece comparing the show to the sopranos  mad men and the wire  chuck klosterman said that breaking bad is  built on the uncomfortable premise that there s an irrefutable difference between what s right and what s wrong  and it s the only one where the characters have real control over how they choose to live   klosterman added that the central question of breaking bad is   what makes a man  bad  â€“ his actions  his motives  or his conscious decision to be a bad person   klosterman concluded that in the world of breaking bad   goodness and badness are simply complicated choices  no different than anything else   18   ross douthat of the new york times  in a response to klosterman s piece  compared breaking bad and the sopranos  stating that both series are  morality plays  that are  both interested in moral agency   douthat went on to say that walter white and tony soprano  represent mirror-image takes on the problem of evil  damnation  and free will   walter is a man who  deliberately abandons the light for the darkness  while tony is  someone born and raised in darkness  who turns down  opportunity after opportunity to claw his way upward to the light   78   devotion to family the show explores most of the main characters  connections to their families in great detail  walt justifies his decision to cook crystal meth and become a criminal because of his desire to provide for his family  79  in the third season he tries to exit the business because it has driven skyler to leave him  gus convinces him to stay  telling him it is a man s job to provide for his family  even if he is unloved  80  in the final episode of the series  walt finally admits to skyler that the main motivation for his endeavors in the meth business was his own interest  in spite of secretly securing the  9 72 million he had managed to salvage for her and the children  jesse s loneliness in the early seasons of the show can be partly explained by his parents  decision to kick him out of their home due to his drug-related activities  this parental disconnect brings him closer to jane  whose father berates her for her drug use  when walt crosses paths with jane s father  walt refers to jesse as his nephew and laments the fact that he cannot get through to him  jane s father responds by telling him to keep trying  saying   family  you can t give up on them  ever  what else is there   81  jane s subsequent death  which walt purposefully did not prevent  is a major factor in her father causing the airliner crash at the end of the second season   even the show s more hardened characters maintain ties to family  in the second season  tuco salamanca spends time caring for his physically disabled uncle  hector  when tuco is killed by hank  his cousins vow revenge  their actions are further explained in a flashback  where hector explains to the brothers that  la familia es todo    family is everything    gustavo fring s franchise los pollos hermanos translates to  the chicken brothers   this refers to the fact that the company was co-founded by gus and a man named max  with whom he shared a romantic relationship  when max is killed by hector salamanca  gus vows to destroy the salamanca family and in particular to humiliate hector and prolong and draw out his suffering  79  in the first part of the fifth season  it is explained that mike ehrmantraut s intentions for being in this business were to provide for his granddaughter s future  and by his final episode he is conflicted when having to leave her in a park by herself once he has been warned that the police are onto him  during the second part of the fifth season  white supremacist jack welker says  don t skimp on family   and he lets walt live after capturing him in the desert because of love for his nephew todd alquist  who has great respect for walt  lydia rodarte-quayle repeatedly demands that if mike insists on killing her  that he leave her in her apartment so her daughter can find her  fearful she will think lydia abandoned her  much like walt and mike  lydia seems to engage in the meth business in order to provide for her daughter  with actress laura fraser stating in an interview that lydia s daughter is important to how  lydia justified what she did to herself   82   pride pride/hubris is a major theme in walter white s tragic character arc  in an interview with the village voice  showrunner vince gilligan identified the tipping point at which walt  breaks bad  as his prideful decision not to accept gretchen and elliott schwartz s offer to pay for his chemotherapy  season 1  episode 5     they offer  walter white  everything he needs  at the end of that hour he says   thank you  no   and he goes back to jesse pinkman and says   let s cook   and that was where the character truly got interesting for me  this guy s got some serious pride issues   83   the critically acclaimed episode  ozymandias  references the percy bysshe shelley poem of the same name  which describes the crumbling legacy of an overly prideful king  84  85  the episode draws parallels to the poem  as both antiheroes are left with little to show for their empire-building efforts  austin gill of xavier university stated the episode  evokes the tyrannical aspirations of invincibility and arrogance of ozymandias himself as represented in shelley s poem   86  douglas eric rasmussen of the university of saskatchewan argued that the  concept of hubris and being punished for grandiose projects that serve an individual s egotism are central aspects of each work   87  hank s death marks the beginning of a shift where it becomes increasingly difficult for walt to continue to insist that he cooks meth for the sake of his family s well-being  by the series finale  walt finally admits to skyler that he became heisenberg for his own ego   i did it for me  i liked it  i was good at it   88   symbols pink teddy bear  the pink teddy bear as seen during the second season a motif within the second season is the image of a damaged teddy bear and its missing eye  the teddy bear first appears at the end of the music video  fallacies  for jesse s band  twaã¼ghthammã«r   which was released as a webisode in february 2009 leading to the second season  89  the teddy bear can also be spotted on the mural on jane s bedroom wall during the final episode of the second season  further connecting the crash to jane  it is seen in flashforwards during four episodes  the titles of which  when put together in order  form the sentence  seven thirty-seven down over abq   90  91  92  the flashforwards are shot in black and white  with the sole exception of the pink teddy bear  which is an homage to the film schindler s list  where the color red is used to distinguish the coat of a very young girl  93  at the end of the season  walter indirectly helps cause the midair collision of two airplanes; 94  95  the pink teddy bear is then revealed to have fallen out of one of the planes and into the whites  swimming pool  vince gilligan called the plane accident an attempt to visualize  all the terrible grief that walt has wrought upon his loved ones  and  the judgment of god   96   in the first episode of the third season  walt finds the teddy bear s missing eye in the pool skimmer  television critic myles mcnutt has called it  a symbol of the damage  walter  feels responsible for   97  and the a v  club commented that  the pink teddy bear continues to accuse   98  fans and critics have compared the appearance of the teddy bear s face to an image of gus fring s face in the fourth-season finale  99   the teddy bear prop was auctioned off  among other memorabilia  on september 29  2013  the air date of the show finale  100  101   colors a recurring symbol within breaking bad is the use of color  particularly the characters  color for wardrobe  being used to represent a character s state of mind or a relationship between characters or to foreshadow an event  102  in an interview with vulture  vince gilligan says  color is important on breaking bad; we always try to think in terms of it  we always try to think of the color that a character is dressed in  in the sense that it represents on some level their state of mind   103   walt whitman walter white s name is reminiscent of the poet walt whitman  91  during the series  gale boetticher gives walt a copy of whitman s leaves of grass  104  prior to giving this gift  boetticher recites  when i heard the learn d astronomer   105  in the episode  bullet points   hank finds the initials w w  written in boetticher s notes  and jokes with walt that they are his initials  although walt indicates that they must refer to whitman   in the episode  hazard pay   walt finds the copy of leaves of grass as he is packing up his bedroom  briefly smiles  and leaves it out to read  this occurs at an especially high point in his life  when he feels that things are coming together and he is succeeding in all his ventures  a poem in the book   song of myself   is based on many of these same feelings  furthering the connection between walt s life and whitman s poetry  106  the mid-season finale of season five   gliding over all   is titled after poem 271 of leaves of grass  107  in the episode  hank finds leaves of grass in walt s bathroom and opens it to the cover page  where he reads the hand-written inscription   to my other favorite w w  it s an honour working with you  fondly g b   upon reading this  hank becomes visibly shocked  realizing the truth about walter for the

series  particularly the acting of cranston and paul  stating  cranston and paul are so good  it s astounding  i d say the two have created great chemistry  but i m ashamed to say such a cheap thing   133  robert bianco of usa today also praised cranston and paul  exclaiming  there is humor in the show  mostly in walt s efforts to impose scholarly logic on the business and on his idiot apprentice  a role paul plays very well  but even their scenes lean toward the suspenseful  as the duo learns that killing someone  even in self-defense  is ugly  messy work   134   the second season saw critical acclaim  entertainment weekly critic ken tucker stated  bad is a superlatively fresh metaphor for a middle-age crisis  it took cancer and lawbreaking to jolt walt out of his suburban stupor  to experience life againâ€”to take chances  risk danger  do things he didn t think himself capable of doing  none of this would work  of course  without emmy winner cranston s ferocious  funny selflessness as an actor  for all its bleakness and darkness  there s a glowing exhilaration about this series  it s a feel-good show about feeling really bad   135  san francisco chronicle s tim goodman claimed  the first three episodes of season 2 that amc sent out continue that level of achievement with no evident missteps  in fact  it looks as if gilligan s bold vision for breaking bad

pointing out the  visual adventurousness  of the series  goodman went on to call the show s visuals  a combination of staggering beauty â€“ the directors make use of numerous wide-angle landscape portraits â€“ and transfixing weirdness   140  after the finale aired  the a v  club said that season three was  one of television s finest dramatic accomplishments  and what makes it so exciting â€“ what makes the recognition of the current golden age so pressing â€“ is that the season has not been  as  another reviewer  put it in another context   television good   the heart-in-the-throat quality of this season comes as much from the writers  exhilarating disregard for television conventions as from the events portrayed   141   season four won near-universal critical acclaim  the boston globe referred to the show as a  taut exercise in withheld disaster  and declared the show  riveting   142  the pittsburgh post-gazette labeled the series  smart and thought provoking that

knocks  line as one of the best television lines of 2011  145  the pittsburgh post-gazette listed it as the best series of 2011 while noting that  breaking bad is that rare tv series that has never made a seriously damaging storytelling misstep   146  the a v  club s review of the finale summed it up as a  fantastically fitting end for a season that ran in slow motion  starting and continuing with so many crises begging for resolution week after week  now the decks are cleared  but that doesn t mean anybody is home free  nothing s ever easy on breaking bad   the reviewer continued to exalt the season  and proclaimed   what a season of television â€“ truly something none of us could ever have expected  or claimed we deserved   147   both halves of the fifth season received overwhelming critical acclaim  following the end of the series  critic nick harley summarized his commendation of the show   expertly written  virtuosic with its direction  and flawlessly performed  breaking bad is everything you could want in a drama  critics will spend the next decade dissecting and arguing about what made it great  but the reasons are endless and already well documented   148  during the final season  the show also received praise from george r  r  martin  author of the a song of ice and fire novels  particularly the episode  ozymandias ; martin commented that  walter white is a bigger monster than anyone in westeros   149  in his review of the second half of season 5  seth amitin of ign stated   this final batch of breaking bad is one of the best run of episodes tv has ever

don t remember who said what  and it doesn t even matter whose idea was whose  but i remember one afternoon  somebody said â€” and i was kind of into it for a while â€”  wouldn t it be really ironic if walt is the only one to survive this   because it does seem so obvious that walt should expire at the end of the final episode â€” but maybe he s the only one left alive  maybe he still does have a death sentence  but we go out on him alive  and maybe his whole family s been wiped out  that would have been really fâ€”ing dark    â€”vince gilligan  on an alternate ending 187  variety held a q a with most of the original writing staff to reflect on the show s run  the final season  the writing process  and alternative endings  along with creator vince gilligan  fellow writers and producers peter gould  thomas schnauz  gennifer hutchison  moira walley-beckett  sam catlin and george mastras joined to discuss memories from the show s humble beginnings  character transformations that concluded in the final season as well as surprising developments along the way  for instance  the character of jesse pinkman was originally supposed to die halfway through season one in a tragic drug deal gone horribly wrong  the reasoning behind this decision was that jesse served his purpose  in a meat-and-potatoes  logistical sense  the character would give walt his entrã©e into the business  before meeting his demise  however  this was eventually done away with as the story progressed beyond gilligan s early scripts  187   the writers also opened up on their collaborative process and how their form of storytelling evolved with the show  according to writer george mastras    screen time was precious  and infusing every moment with the emotion  was the point   not just forming the pieces of the puzzle to tell the story  which is hard enough  if you re going to take five seconds of screen time  you d better damn well be sure that there s an emotion there  it may be very  very subtle  but trust the audiences to pick up on that  because audiences do   187   the development of certain characters posed challenges  skyler white became unsympathetic to most viewers in earlier seasons as she was often presented as an obstacle to walt s ultimate agenda  the writers struggled to change the dynamic and realized that  the only way people were going to like skyler was if she started going along with what walt was doing   it was a tricky shift to alter on screen because they didn t want to betray her character so they justified the change by using her past job as a bookkeeper to segue into her helping walt money launder his cash under the guise of a car wash  breaking the individual episodes was another form of problem-solving for the writers  they stressed the
