as a csi-style medical detective program  5  a hospital whodunit in which the doctors investigated symptoms and their causes  6  attanasio was inspired to develop a medical procedural drama by the new york times magazine column  diagnosis   written by physician lisa sanders  who is an attending physician at yale–new haven hospital  ynhh ; the fictitious princeton–plainsboro teaching hospital  ppth  not to be confused with the university medical center of princeton at plainsboro  is modeled after this teaching institution  7  fox bought the series  though the network s then-president  gail berman  told the creative team   i want a medical show  but i don t want to see white coats going down the hallway   8  jacobs has said that this stipulation was one of the many influences that led to the show s ultimate form  8   we knew the network was looking for procedurals  and paul  attanasio  came up with this medical idea that was like a cop procedural  the suspects were the germs  but i quickly began to realize that we needed that character element  i mean  germs don t have motives   —david shore to writer s guild magazine 9  after fox picked up the show  it acquired the working title chasing zebras  circling the drain 10    zebra  is medical slang for an unusual or obscure diagnosis  while  circling the drain  refers to terminal cases  patients in an irreversible decline   11  the original premise of the show was of a team of doctors working together trying to  diagnose the undiagnosable   12  shore felt it was important to have an interesting central character  one who could examine patients  personal characteristics and diagnose their ailments by figuring out their secrets and lies  12  as shore and the rest of the creative team explored the character s possibilities  the program concept became less of procedure and more focused upon the lead role  13  the character was named  house   which was adopted as the show s title  as well  10  shore developed the characters further and wrote the script for the pilot episode  5  bryan singer  who directed the pilot episode and had a major role in casting the primary roles  has said that the  title of the pilot was  everybody lies   and that s the premise of the show   13  shore has said that the central storylines of several early episodes were based on the work of berton roueché  a staff writer for the new yorker between 1944 and 1994  who specialized in features about unusual medical cases  6   shore traced the concept for the title character to his experience as a patient at a teaching hospital  14  he recalled   i knew  as soon as i left the room  they would be mocking me relentlessly  for my cluelessness  and i thought that it would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room   15  a central part of the show s premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way  16  the original idea was for house to use a wheelchair  but fox rejected this  jacobs later expressed her gratitude for the network s insistence that the character be reimagined—putting him on his feet added a crucial physical dimension  13  the writers ultimately chose to give house a damaged leg arising from an incorrect diagnosis  which requires him to use a cane and causes him pain that leads to a narcotic dependency  16   references to sherlock holmes  sherlock holmes serves as an inspiration for the series  references to fictional detective sherlock holmes appear throughout the series  17  18  shore explained that he was always a holmes fan and found the character s indifference to his clients unique  15  the resemblance is evident in house s reliance on inductive reasoning 17  and psychology  even where it might not seem obviously applicable  11  and his reluctance to accept cases he finds uninteresting  19  house s investigatory method is to eliminate diagnoses logically as they are proved impossible; holmes uses a similar method  10  both characters play instruments  house plays the piano  the guitar  and the harmonica; holmes  the violin  and take drugs  house is dependent on vicodin; holmes uses cocaine recreationally   17  house s relationship with dr  james wilson echoes that between holmes and his confidant  dr  john watson  10  robert sean leonard  who portrays wilson  said that house and his character were originally intended to work together much as holmes and watson do; in his view  house s diagnostic team has assumed that aspect of the watson role  20  shore said that house s name itself is meant as  a subtle homage  to holmes  10  21  house s address is 221b baker street  a direct reference to holmes s street address  11  wilson s address is also 221b  22   individual episodes of the series contain additional references to the sherlock holmes tales  the main patient in the pilot episode is named rebecca adler after irene adler  a character in the first holmes short story   a scandal in bohemia   23  in the season two finale  house is shot by a crazed gunman credited as  moriarty   the name of holmes s nemesis  24  in the season four episode  it s a wonderful lie   house receives a  second-edition conan doyle  as a christmas gift  25  in the season five episode  the itch   house is seen picking up his keys and vicodin from the top of a copy of conan doyle s the memoirs of sherlock holmes  26  in another season five episode   joy to the world   house  in an attempt to fool his team  uses a book by joseph bell  conan doyle s inspiration for sherlock holmes  10  the volume had been given to him the previous christmas by wilson  who included the message  greg  made me think of you   before acknowledging that he gave the book to house  wilson tells two of the team members that its source was a patient  irene adler  27  season 7 episode 3 includes a young adult boyhood detective book series written by the patient  whose final unpublished volume ends in an ambiguous end to the main character reminiscent of  the final problem   the series finale also pays homage to holmes s apparent death in  the final problem   the 1893 story with which conan doyle originally intended to conclude the holmes chronicles  28   production team  bryan singer directed the pilot episode and the third episode   occam s razor   29  house was a co-production of heel and toe films  shore z productions  and bad hat harry productions in association with universal network television for fox  30  paul attanasio and katie jacobs  the heads of heel and toe films; david shore  the head of shore z productions; and bryan singer  the head of bad hat harry productions  were executive producers of the program for its entirety  14  lawrence kaplow  peter blake  and thomas l  moran joined the staff as writers at the beginning of the first season after the making of the pilot episode  writers doris egan  sara hess  russel friend  and garrett lerner joined the team at the start of season two  friend and lerner  who are business partners  had been offered positions when the series launched  but turned the opportunity down  after observing the show s success  they accepted when jacobs offered them jobs again the following year  31  writers eli attie and sean whitesell joined the show at the start of season four; attie would stay on the show s writing staff through the series finale  which he co-wrote  from the beginning of season four  moran  friend  and lerner were credited as executive producers on the series  joining attanasio  jacobs  shore  and singer  30  hugh laurie was credited as an executive producer for the second 32  and third 33  episodes of season five   shore was house s showrunner  34  through the end of the sixth season  more than two dozen writers had contributed to the program  the most prolific were kaplow  18 episodes   blake  17   shore  16   friend  16   lerner  16   moran  14   and egan  13   the show s most prolific directors through its first six seasons were deran sarafian  22 episodes   who was not involved in season six  and greg yaitanes  17   of the more than three dozen other directors who have worked on the series  only david straiton directed as many as 10 episodes through the sixth season  hugh laurie directed the 17th episode of season six   lockdown   35  elan soltes was the visual effects supervisor since the show began  36  lisa sanders  an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the yale school of medicine  was a technical advisor to the series  she writes the  diagnosis  column that inspired house s premise  37  according to shore    t hree different doctors     check everything we do   38  bobbin bergstrom  a registered nurse  was the program s on-set medical adviser  38   casting  hugh laurie made his own audition tape while shooting a film in namibia  at first  the producers were looking for a  quintessentially american person  to play the role of house  39  bryan singer in particular felt there was no way he was going to hire a non-american actor for the role  12  at the time of the casting session  actor hugh laurie was in namibia filming the movie flight of the phoenix  he assembled an audition tape in a hotel bathroom  the only place with enough light  39  and apologized for its appearance 40   which singer compared to a  bin laden video    41  laurie improvised  using an umbrella for a cane  singer was very impressed by his performance and commented on how well the  american actor  was able to grasp the character  12  42  singer was not aware that laurie was english  due to his american accent  laurie credits the accent to  a misspent youth  watching  too much tv and too many movies   39  although locally better-known actors such as denis leary  david cross  rob morrow  and patrick dempsey were considered for the part  shore  jacobs  and attanasio were as impressed as singer and cast laurie as house  43   it wasn t a massive move when i first considered  doing house   what usually happens is you do a pilot and of the very few picked up  only about a quarter go to a second year  so i thought i ll have three fun weeks  i never dreamed i d be here three and a half years later   —hugh laurie 44  laurie later revealed that he initially thought the show s central character was dr  james wilson  he assumed that house was a supporting part  due to the nature of the character  until he received the full script of the pilot episode  45  laurie  the son of medical doctor ran laurie  said he felt guilty for  being paid more to become a fake version of  his  own father   39  from the start of season three  he was being paid  275 000 to  300 000 per episode  as much as three times what he had previously been making on the series  46  laurie was earning around  400 000 per episode by the fifth season  47  and  700 000 per episode for the final season  making him one of the highest-paid actors on network television  48  49   robert sean leonard had received the script for the cbs show numb3rs as well as that for house  50  leonard thought the numb3rs script was  kind of cool  and planned to audition for the show  50  however  he decided that the character he was up for  charlie eppes  was in too many scenes; he later observed   the less i work  the happier i am   50  he believed that his house audition was not particularly good  but that his lengthy friendship with singer helped win him the part of dr  wilson  50  singer had enjoyed lisa edelstein s portrayal of a prostitute on the west wing  and sent her a copy of the pilot script  51  edelstein was attracted to the quality of the writing and her character s  snappy dialogue  with house  and was cast as dr  lisa cuddy  51   australian actor jesse spencer s agent suggested that he audition for the role of dr  robert chase  spencer believed the program would be similar in style to general hospital but changed his mind after reading the scripts  52  after he was cast  he persuaded the producers to turn the character into an australian  53  patrick dempsey also auditioned for the part of chase; he later became known for his portrayal of dr  derek shepherd on grey s anatomy  54  omar epps  who plays dr  eric foreman  was inspired by his earlier portrayal of a troubled intern on the nbc medical drama er; 55  his character was given the name  eric foreman  despite the fact that fox was still airing that 70 s show when house premiered and had the similarly named eric forman as that series  main protagonist   the two series overlapped on fox s schedule for two seasons  though topher grace left that 70 s show at the end of its 7th season and house s first  only returning for that show s series finale   jennifer morrison felt that her audition for the part of dr  allison cameron was a complete disaster  56  however  before her audition  singer had watched some of her performances  including on dawson s creek  and already wanted to cast her in the role  56  morrison left the show when her character was written out in the middle of season six  57   at the end of season three  house dismisses chase  while foreman and cameron resign  58  after an episode in which he  borrows  a janitor whom he calls  dr  buffer  to assist in a diagnosis  house must then recruit a new diagnostic team  for which he identifies seven finalists  the producers originally planned to recruit two new full-time actors  with foreman  who returns in season four s fifth episode  bringing the team back up to three members; ultimately  the decision was made to add three new regular cast members  59   along with epps  actors morrison and spencer remained in the cast  as their characters moved on to new assignments   during production  the show s writers dismissed a single candidate per episode; as a result  said jacobs  neither the producers nor the cast knew who was going to be hired until the last minute  60  in the season s ninth episode  house s new team is revealed  foreman is joined by doctors lawrence kutner  kal penn   61  chris taub  peter jacobson   62  and remy  thirteen  hadley  olivia wilde   63  the candidates rejected by house did not return to the show  with the exception of the last one cut  amber  cutthroat bitch  volakis  anne dudek   who appeared for the rest of season four as wilson s girlfriend  64  and in seasons five and eight as a hallucination of house s  65  while penn and wilde had higher profiles than the actors who played the other finalists  jacobs said they went through an identical audition process and stayed with the show based on the writers  interest in their characters  60  kutner was written out of the series in episode 20 of season 5 after penn took a position in the obama white house office of public engagement and intergovernmental affairs  66   the contracts of edelstein  epps  and leonard expired at the end of season seven  as a cost-cutting measure  the three actors were asked to accept reduced salaries  epps and leonard came to terms with the producers  but edelstein did not  and in may 2011  it was announced that she would not be returning for the show s eighth season  67   filming style and locations  frist campus center is the source of the aerial views of ppth  house is often filmed using the  walk and talk  filming technique  8  19  popularized on television by series such as st  elsewhere  er  sports night  and the west wing  68  the technique involves the use of tracking shots  showing two or more characters walking between locations while talking  68  executive producer katie jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because  when you put a scene on the move  it s a     way of creating an urgency and an intensity   8  she noted the significance of  the fact that hugh laurie spans 6 2  and is taller than everybody else because it certainly makes those walk-and-talks pop   8  nancy franklin of the new yorker described the show s  cool  fantastic voyage–like special effects of patients  innards  i ll bet you didn t know that when your kidneys shut down they sound like bubble wrap popping   69   cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat  of one patient  another critic observed   but up her nose and inside her brain and leg   70  instead of relying primarily on computer-generated imagery  the interior body shots tend to involve miniature effects and motion control photography  36  many of the sets are dressed with a variety of unscripted props that allow laurie to physically improvise  revealing aspects of his character and the story  8   the pilot episode was filmed in vancouver; primary photography for all subsequent episodes took place on the fox lot in century city  los angeles  38  bryan singer chose the hospital near his hometown  west windsor  new jersey  as the show s fictional setting  14  princeton university s frist campus center d  is the source of the aerial views of princeton–plainsboro teaching hospital seen in the series  72  some filming took place at the university of southern california for the season-three episode  half-wit   which guest-starred dave matthews and kurtwood smith  73  part of house s sixth season was filmed at the abandoned greystone park psychiatric hospital  in parsippany-troy hills  new jersey  as the fictional mayfield psychiatric hospital  74   opening sequence the opening sequence begins with an mri of a head with an image of the boxed  h  from the logo  the international symbol for hospital  in the foreground  this is then overlaid with an image of dr  house s face taken from the pilot episode with the show s full title appearing across his face  house s head then fades and the show s title is underlined and has the  m d   appear next to it  producing the entire logo of the show  this was the full extent of the title sequence in the pilot episode  75  all subsequent episodes contain a longer sequence including the names of the six featured cast members and creator david shore  laurie s name appears first  followed by the names of the five other featured cast members in alphabetical order  edelstein  epps  leonard  morrison  and spencer   then shore  76   after the show s title fades  an aerial view of ppth  actually various princeton university buildings  primarily frist campus center  72  is followed by a series of images accompanying each member s name; most are shown next to  or superimposed upon  illustrations of human anatomy  laurie s name appears next to a model of a human head with the brain exposed; edelstein s name appears next to a visual effects–produced graphic of an angiogram of the heart  epps s name is superimposed upon a rib cage x-ray; leonard s name appears on a drawing of the two hemispheres of the brain  76  the producers originally wanted to include an image of a cane and an image of a vicodin bottle  but fox objected  morrison s title card was thus lacking an image; an aerial shot of rowers on princeton university s lake carnegie was finally agreed upon to accompany her name  77  spencer s name appears next to an old-fashioned anatomical drawing of a spine  between the presentations of spencer and shore s names is a scene of house and his three original team members walking down one of the hospital s hallways  76  jacobs said that most of the backgrounds have no specific meaning; however  the final image—the text  created by david shore  superimposed upon a human neck—connotes that shore is  the brain of the show   77  the sequence was nominated for a primetime emmy award for outstanding main title design in 2005  78  the title sequence continued to credit spencer and morrison  even when their characters were reduced to background roles during seasons four and five  and morrison even after hers was written out  a new opening sequence was introduced in season seven to accommodate the changes in the cast  removing morrison s name and including jacobson s and wilde s  it was updated in season eight  removing edelstein s and wilde s names and adding annable s and yi s  79  80   the series  original opening theme  as heard in the united states  comprises instrumental portions of  teardrop  by massive attack  81  the piece was used in part because of the distinct tempo which roughly mimics the sound of a beating human heart  82  an acoustic version of  teardrop   with guitar and vocals by josé gonzález  is heard as background music during the season-four finale  83   series overview see also  list of house episodes anytime you try to summarize a show in one word  you sound like an ass  it s about truth   —david shore 84  gregory house  m d   often construed as a misanthropic medical genius  85  heads a team of diagnosticians at the princeton–plainsboro teaching hospital in new jersey  75  the series is structured around a central plot with some supporting secondary stories and narratives that cross over seasons  most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a cold open set outside the hospital  showing events ending with the onset of the patient s symptoms  19  the typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient s illness  81  86  which often fail until the patient s condition is critical  81  they usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed  72  and house routinely rejects cases he does not find interesting  19   typically  the patient is misdiagnosed at least once which usually causes further complications  but the nature of the complications often provides new evidence which helps them diagnose the patient correctly  19  house often tends to arrive at the correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue  often inspired by a passing remark made by another character  86  diagnoses range from relatively common to very rare diseases  87   the team faces many diagnostic difficulties from patients  concealment of symptoms  circumstances  or personal histories  so house frequently proclaims during the team s deliberations   the patient is lying   or mutters  everybody lies ; such an assumption guides house s decisions and diagnoses 11  and makes the countermeasure of housebreaking a routine procedure  because many of his hypotheses are based on epiphanies or controversial insights  he often has trouble obtaining permission for medical procedures he considers necessary from his superior  who in all but the final season is hospital administrator dr  lisa cuddy  88  this is especially the case when the proposed procedures involve a high degree of risk or are ethically questionable  frequent disagreements occur between house and his team  89  especially dr  allison cameron  whose standards of medical ethics are more conservative than those of the other characters  81   like all of the hospital s doctors  house is required to treat patients in the facility s walk-in clinic  75  90  his grudging fulfillment of this duty  or his creative methods of avoiding it  constitute a recurring subplot  which often serves as the series  comic relief  81  91  during clinic duty  house confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives  eccentric prescriptions  and unorthodox treatments  75  however  after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints  he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses  17  analogies with some of the simple cases in the clinic occasionally inspire insights that help solve the team s case  19  92   it s not a show about addiction  but you can t throw something like this into the mix and not expect it to be noticed and commented on  there have been references to the amount of his consumption increasing over time  it s becoming less and less useful a tool for dealing with his pain  and it s something we re going to continue to deal with  continue to explore   —shore on house s vicodin addiction 93  a significant plot element is house s use of vicodin to manage pain  caused by an infarction in the quadriceps muscle of his right leg five years before the show s first season  which also forces him to use a cane  94  in the first-season 11th episode  detox   house admits he is addicted to vicodin but says he does not have a problem because the pills  let me do my job  and they take away my pain   e  his addiction has led his colleagues cuddy and dr  james wilson to encourage him to go to drug rehabilitation several times  96  when he has no access to vicodin or experiences unusually intense pain  he occasionally self-medicates with other narcotic analgesics such as morphine  97  oxycodone  98  and methadone  99  house also frequently drinks liquor when he is not on medical duty and classifies himself as a  big drinker   100  toward the end of season five  house begins to hallucinate; after eliminating other possible diagnoses  wilson and he determine that his vicodin addiction is the most likely cause  101  house goes into denial about this for a brief time  but at the close of the season finale  he commits himself to mayfield psychiatric hospital  102  in the following season s debut episode  house leaves mayfield with his addiction under control  103  however  about a year and a half later  in season seven s 15th episode   bombshells   house

caliber of acting and script   70  the onion s  a v  club  approvingly described it as the  nastiest  black comedy from fox since 1996 s short-lived profit  167  new york s john leonard called the series  medical tv at its most satisfying and basic   168  while the boston globe s matthew gilbert appreciated that the show did not attempt to hide the flaws of the characters to assuage viewers  fears about  hmo factories   169  variety s brian lowry  less impressed  wrote that the show relied on  by-the-numbers storytelling  albeit in a glossy package   170  tim goodman of the san francisco chronicle described it as  mediocre  and unoriginal  171  mikhail varshavski  a russian-american osteopathic doctor  reviewed the medical content of house on his youtube channel  according to varshavski  the medical information presented on the show was usually fundamentally accurate though often highly exaggerated for dramatic effect  but he described gregory house s tendency to quickly use invasive tests and procedures as outside the medical mainstream  172  173  174   general critical reaction to the character of gregory house was particularly positive  163  175  tom shales of the washington post called him  the most electrifying new main character to hit television in years   176  the pittsburgh post-gazette s rob owen found him  fascinatingly unsympathetic   177  critics have compared house to fictional detectives nero wolfe  178  hercule poirot  and adrian monk  179  and to perry cox  a cantankerous doctor on the television show scrubs  164  177  one book-length study of

post s shales called a  first-rate ensemble   176  leonard s portrayal of dr  wilson has been considered emmy award worthy by critics with tv guide  entertainment weekly  and usa today  182  183  bianculli of the daily news was happy to see edelstein  was finally given a deservedly meaty co-starring role   70  freelance critic daniel fienberg was disappointed that leonard and edelstein have not received more recognition for their performances  184   reaction to the major shifts of season four was mixed   with the new crew in place house takes on a slightly more energized feel   wrote todd douglass jr  of dvd talk   and the set up  sic  for the fifth season is quite brilliant   185  the star-ledger s alan sepinwall wrote   the extended  enormous job audition gave the writers a chance to reinvigorate the show and fully embrace laurie s comic genius   135  mary mcnamara of the los angeles times  on the other hand  took issue with the developments   the cast just kept getting bigger  the stories more scattered and uneven until you had a bunch of great actors forced to stand around watching hugh laurie hold the show together by the sheer force of his will   186  usa today s robert bianco cheered the season finale   talk about saving the best for last  with two fabulous  heartbreaking hours     the writers rescued a season that had seemed diffuse  overcrowded and perhaps too ambitious for its own good   183   season five of house was met with a more positive response in comparison to the previous season  it holds a metacritic score of 77 out of 100  based on ten reviews  indicating  generally favorable reviews   187  it also holds a 100% approval rating on aggregate review website rotten tomatoes  with an average score of 8 1 based on nine collected reviews  188  usa today praised laurie s performance and the repercussions of the season-four finale  stating  a carry-over from last season s brilliant finale  house is firmly in the forefront  and when you have an actor of hugh laurie s range  depth and charisma  putting him center-stage makes perfect sense  particularly when you ve written a story that explores the character and his primary relationships in a way that seems integral to the series   189  the new york daily news noted that  the show pays more attention to relationships we care about  hints at a sensible number of new ones that show some promise  and thus doesn t rely on obscure medical mysteries to carry the whole dramatic burden   and noted that  the prognosis for this season could be better than last season seemed to foreshadow   190  mary mcnamara of the los angeles times highlighted the performances of the cast  especially michael weston as detective lucas douglas  calling him a  delightful addition   she concluded   so different is the premiere that the savvy house  and fox  viewer may expect the revelation that it was all a fever dream  that does not seem to be the case  and one assumes that laurie and the writers will be bringing a different version of their now-iconic character back to princeton  not too different  of course  but different enough   186  conversely  the chicago tribune s maureen ryan disliked weston s character  calling him  an unwelcome distraction     an irritating pipsqueak   191  she continued saying  house used to be one of the best shows on tv  but it s gone seriously off the rails   the sunday times felt that the show had  lost its sense of humour   192  the focus on thirteen and her eventual involvement with foreman also came under particular criticism  135  193   at the end of the show s run  steven tong of entertainment weekly wrote that  house had  in its final seasons  become a rather sentimental show   194  in new york magazine s blog  vulture   margaret lyons wrote   more than a hospital drama or a character piece or anything else  house is a complex meditation on misery   but  continued lyons  there is a line between  enlightened cynicism  and  misery-entropy   and  as the show wore on  its dramatic flare dimmed while its agony flare burned ever brighter   195  alan sepinwall wrote   the repetition and muck of  the  middle seasons ultimately severed whatever emotional connection i had to house s personal struggles   28   in 2007  house placed  62 on entertainment weekly s  new tv classics  list  196  the show was declared the
